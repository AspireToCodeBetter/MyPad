Services

We specialize in developing custom web applications and providing analytics.

We follow a well planned development process in all our engagements and aspire to give our client the benefits of a nimble footed freelancer while maintaining the discipline and organization of a well structured team.

Our engagement process is divided into the following three steps:

1) Understand requirements and prototype them

2) Freeze on requirements and finalize delivery schedule

3) Develop and push code for quick feedback

At MyPad.in, we try our best to do a few things but do it really well. We resist the temptation to take up projects in the "latest" technologies unless we are really comfortable with it and see a "real business case" to make the transition.

We focus all our offerings around the following technologies and frameworks.

- Content Management System (CMS): PyroCMS is our CMS of choice. It is very well designed, easy to use, the code is extremely manageable. The architecture is very flexible and does not limit our ability to be creative in **any** way.

- Programming Framework: CodeIgniter is the PHP framework that we use. Code Igniter is very well accepted in the market and we are very happy with the products that we have been able to develop using Code Igniter.

- Database: MySQL and MongoDB. Both of them are free and very reliable. The decision of using MySQL or MongoDB is completely dependent on the use-case of the project and both offer significant advantages in their own right.

- Analytics Tools: R-Project is our main analytics tool. It is open-source, extremely reliable and one of the most sought after analytical platforms in the market today.
